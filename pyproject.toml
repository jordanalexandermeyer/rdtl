The `pyproject.toml` file specifies the build system requirements and project metadata needed for building and packaging the Python library.

Here are some common elements that may be included in a `pyproject.toml` file for a Python library:

- The build system requirements for building the library. This can include dependencies such as build tools, compilers, and other libraries needed to build the package.
- The metadata for the library, such as the name, version, author, and description of the library.
- The configuration for the build process, including options such as where to output the built files, which files to include or exclude, and other build-related settings.

The `pyproject.toml` file is used by the `build` and `install` commands in `pip` to build and install the package.
