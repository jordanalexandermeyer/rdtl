The `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file used in Python libraries that adopt the newer `PEP 517`/`PEP 518` standard for building and packaging. The file specifies the build system requirements and project metadata needed for building and packaging the Python library.

Here are some common elements that may be included in a `pyproject.toml` file for a Python library:

- The build system requirements for building the library. This can include dependencies such as build tools, compilers, and other libraries needed to build the package.
- The metadata for the library, such as the name, version, author, and description of the library.
- The configuration for the build process, including options such as where to output the built files, which files to include or exclude, and other build-related settings.

The `pyproject.toml` file is used by the `build` and `install` commands in `pip` to build and install the package. The `PEP 517` standard allows for building and packaging of Python libraries using a variety of build backends, such as `setuptools`, `flit`, and `poetry`, among others.

Overall, the `pyproject.toml` file is an important part of building and packaging Python libraries, as it specifies the build system requirements and project metadata needed for building and packaging the library using the `PEP 517` standard.
