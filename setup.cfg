# A `setup.cfg` file is a configuration file that is used in Python libraries to specify additional configuration options for the `setup.py` script. The `setup.cfg` file is used to specify options for building, distributing, and installing a Python library.

# The `setup.cfg` file is a plain text file that is located in the root directory of the library. It is optional, and if it is not present, the `setup.py` script will use default options.

# The `setup.cfg` file can be used to specify options for building and distributing the library, such as the list of files to include in the distribution package, and the format of the distribution package.
